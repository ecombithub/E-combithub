                                    <p>No, deleting a Shopify app does not cancel the subscription associated with it.  App subscriptions are managed separately from app installations. Deleting the app from your Shopify store only removes its functionality from your store's admin interface and storefront but does not affect the subscription or billing status. You can Cancel the Shopify subscription by accessing the Shopify admin dashboard. </p>
